# Bricks Breaker
Bricks Breaker is one of the most famous and one of the first computer games that has been published. I Have implemented this game with java and also with the help of javaFX framework.
In this game all you have to do is to shoot the ball withthe racket to the bricks and hit bricks as much as the number written on them to pop them. if you pop the rquired amount of bricks you win and if you miss to shoot the ball, you lose.

## Gifts
some bricks in this game contains gifts. there are 3 type of gifts:
### Score Doubler
### Racket Length Doubler
### Slower Ball Speed 

## Features
By going in the settings of the game, you can change the ball speed, object colors, and required number of bricks to pop.

## Installation
since this project is implemented based on javaFX, you have to install javaFX(JDK 8) to run this game. but I have put a demo which I had played the game and show its features.
